      <h2><span class="eyesorelogo">EyeSore</span> Lore</h2>
      <p>Mr. Christopher Spendlebrok was an ordinary person. Or so it seems. You see, Christopher was a wizard
        with a mission. The gods above are cruelly ruling the universe through wires, connections between a
        cause of death and an action. When something dies on the cause of death, the action that is connected to
        the cause of death through a wire is triggered.</p>
      <p>One day, the monocle falls from the sky. This is what the gods used to see and
        create the wires that control the universe. This is where the starting cutscene
        takes place, in the field outside Christopher's house, which, legend has it is
        inside of a farming simulator, although this hasn't been confirmed.
        Christopher exitedly picks up the
        monocle, as this could be the turning point, the thing that lets him destroy the
        gods. He puts it over his eye, and, for only a second, sees the wires. Unfortunately
        the gods know of his sins, and summon his eyeball to pop out and run underground,
        under which is a large cave system.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Christopher enchants a humble ice
        cream seller, who barges through the ground into the tunnels and starts chasing the eyeball.
        Unfortunately, in a cruel twist, because Christopher encarnated Ice Cream Kid as a
        last desperate messure, he is crushed by a cave-in triggered by the Ice Cream Kid's entrance to the caves. In
        the eyes of the gods, Christopher had commited many a terrible sin, and that was punishment built into the
        universe that the current gods' infinitely more powerful fathers had created.</p>
      <p>Beyond the site of one of the areas affected by the cave-in, using the double jump glitch, you can get to a
        memorial to Christopher, featuring an unused dark tileset and Christopher's other eye.
        There is some text which reads:</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Nixie One', cursive; padding: 25px; width: 80%; margin: auto;">"In memory of
        Christopher Spendlebrok, who died fighting the gods. May this be a warning to all who seek to destroy
        powers they cannot understand. This is a warning that you have already heeded, eyeball. You have been
        forever trapped underground, along with
        the monocle. You must never defy the power of the gods."</p>
      <p class="twentyfour">
        In a way, Christopher's mission has been achieved. The gods are unable to continue ruling the universe, with no
        way to create and edit wires. However, there are many wires still in place, even if they are out of the gods' reach
        which still keep mortals from reaching any sort of power.
        Christopher's eyeball (who is not controlled by the gods anymore and now knows its mistakes)
        and the Ice Cream Kid both feel a need to avenge
        the death of Christopher, and so we might make a sequel to EyeSore, either in our free time or for <a
          href="https://ogpc.info" target="_blank">OGPC</a> (if the theme allows for it).
      </p>
      <p>
          Anyways, as the credits say, thank you so much for playing EyeSore if
          you did. This was a real challenge for all of our team and we are very
          proud of what we have accomplished. If you loved EyeSore and want to thank
          us, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EpimetheusGamesOGPC" target="_blank">

      <h2>Project Prometheus Lore</h2>
      <p>In the year 2078, a person named Alex Harvey is recruited by a united global government to oversee Project Prometheus, 
      which aimed to build a "Dyson Swarm" around the sun, which, when finished, would harvest enough energy to hopefully aid 
      earth in interstellar travel, and become the future of humanity. After years of planning, the government is ready to send 
      a probe of state-of-the-art droids to Mercury to mine rock and build the facility. But, they need a small team of people 
      to do maintenance on the droids until the facility is large enough to be self-sustaining. The ride to Mercury is long and 
      uneventful, with the droids laying dormant and the humans in cryo tubes. When they get there, the droids set up camp and 
      begin building the facility, constructing buildings from the bare rock and minerals of which the planet is made of. The 
      humans don’t have much to do, but every few Earth days they have to go out and perform maintenance on a broken droid.</p>
      <p>A few months later the droids are ready to manage themselves, and the time has come for all the humans to be sent back to 
      earth—supposedly. The facility is ready to become fully managed by an autonomous AI, the revolutionary system called Mk. 8, 
      distributed across the entire facility. But Alex does not want to be replaced, and feels that he cannot go back to his quiet 
      life on planet Earth. When he realizes that his time to leave is upon him, he intercepts messages to Earth telling the ground 
      crew that the humans on Mercury need to go home. He bombs and sabotages critical parts of the facility causing earthquakes 
      scattered throughout the planet and various power failures.</p>
      <p>Alex antagonizes the almost-conscious AI droids, fearing that they will try to force him to leave for Earth. He becomes so wary 
      of the mining droids which were only designed to mine rock and construct buildings that he engineers his own fleet of mindless 
      drones that will follow his every command to guard the humans and put fear into the mining droids’ metal hearts. The droids 
      write things on the walls warning their brethren about dangerous parts of the facility and as an act of resistance. Mk. 8 is 
      never activated.</p>
      <p>Eventually sensors deem that parts of the facility are at risk of exploding or collapsing. A message from the project director 
      on earth informs the team that because his messages are not getting responses and that sensors are detecting danger in the 
      facility, and is shutting down the operation, and giving the humans 4 days to leave for Earth before they will be stranded there. The director of the project, sending a radio broadcast from Earth, instructs the team to return. 
      The team has to leave, and so they lock up the memory, turn off the facility’s system backbone, and leave for home. When the 
      other team members describe Alex’s treason to the project and waste of hundreds of billions of dollars, he is put in jail for 
      life, but not before passing down his mission of a fully human-managed Dyson Swarm project to his daughter, Amelia.
      For about two hundred years, the facility lay dormant. </p>
      <p>Fast forward to the year 2295. The main protagonist, Sam Sparrow, works at a company, DataQuest. DataQuest sends agents to 
      abandoned ruins to collect data and artifacts from the past, and has sent successful projects to Mars, Titan, and multiple 
      other planets, including old underground sites on Earth. They are now sending Sam into the facility on Mercury. </p>
      The spacecraft ride to Mercury takes a few years, but for Sam (you) it only takes a few minutes. You’ve done this a few times 
      before and you are used to it by now. The landing is uneventful, and you walk in the front doors of a massive complex stretching 
      into the distance and into the sky. Before you enter the facility, an automated voice explains to you the rules. “Welcome to the 
      Project Prometheus Central Coordination Complex. Before you enter, we would like to remind you that weapons are not permitted in 
      the facility, except for tools used to perform your job. Failure to comply with this rule will result in an unsatisfactory point 
      on your report. If you are a droid, breaking these rules will result in termination by surveillance drones. Do not touch moving 
      equipment unless you are a [human] maintenance officer or higher rank. These boundaries are in place for your safety and the 
      safety of others. If you have any complaints about these rules, there is an incinerator in the corner, which accepts trash and 
      droids.”</p>
      <p>After this, you walk in and the door shuts behind you. The automated voice says again: “Automated Facility Manager not found. 
      Beginning backup training process. Please wait until first training cycle is completed, and for your safety, do not enter the 
      facility.</p>
      <p>This is the first time that the Mk. 8 system has been truly awakened, but you are not worried. You could probably run Mk. 8 on 
      your laptop if you had the code.</p>
      <p>By using the rocket boots you get by walking through the tool switch component alternator, you jump out of the waiting room and 
      into the facility, where the AI has started training. This is where the main game starts. You start with a few tutorial levels 
      which show how the component alternator works, and then the AI introduces the cycle timer, which kills you if you don’t get the 
      correct item fast enough.</p>
      <p>The AI realizes you're trying to get there right before you enter the room, and sends drills to push you away. But, crawling 
      through the vents, you get around and sneak into the memory room. While you’re doing this, the AI completes its first training 
      cycle, and needs to restart. This allows you to steal the memory and get out. </p>
      <p>While you are going through the corridor outside the memory room, heading for the exit, a representative from DataQuest tells 
      you something through your radio. </p>
      <p>“There’s a malfunction. All the entrances to the facility are being sealed. Additionally, our sensors have detected a large 
      energy mass, originating from satellites orbiting the sun. This is activating several huge machines throughout the facility, 
      which can have the potential to harm employees. We have detected an exit that has not been closed. This exit is 7.2 kilometers 
      away from your location, and it will be dangerous to get to. We will have a hovercraft waiting outside of the facility to accompany you back to Earth, but we are unable to enter the facility. This is your only escape method. Good lu–” The connection with the representative and the outside world is then cut off, and the AI finishes training.
      The levels will be long and meaty, each representing one of the AI’s cycles of training, and each having a core mechanic that 
      they focus on. </p>
      <p>Before the AI begins its third cycle, it traps you in a room, ready to destroy you, but suddenly begins a restart to begin its 
      third cycle, and you escape.</p>
      <p>At the start of the AI’s third cycle, it begins to tell you things about the facility and the company that sent you, giving 
      contradictions and lies so that the player starts to get insight on the background of the story, but still doesn’t know what to 
      believe. </p>
      <p>At the end of the AI’s 6th cycle, you infiltrate one of the “Huge machines” that the representative from your company was 
      talking about, and use it to barge your way to the exit, destroying everything in your path, and fighting off the other huge 
      machines that the AI sends to stop you.</p>
      <p>But as you destroy parts of the facility in your vessel, parts of the AI’s systems are shut down, and by the time you’ve 
      reached the exit, the AI finally shuts off, and you crash out of the facility. Your vessel also shuts down along with the AI, 
      and you crash into the ground, next to a hovercraft waiting for you.</p>
      <p>You crawl out of the machine, and you are put onto a futuristic stretcher and carried away into the hovercraft, which flies 
      away. The surveillance camera that you have used to watch the player the entire time is shut off, and the data is delivered 
      to you. Once you’ve retrieved the data, you escape from the company, back to the small, peaceful house back on Earth, which 
      your grandfather, Alex Harvey, lived in. He was the creator of the facility, and had always dreamed of redoing Project 
      Prometheus' operation without robots, without the constant fear of becoming obsolete to an AI management system. Now you 
      can finally fulfill your grandfather’s dreams, rebuilding the future of humanity.</p>
      <p>In the future outside of the game, you use the data to recreate the facility, but this time operated fully by humans. It is 
      not known if the dyson swarm will be a success.</p>
