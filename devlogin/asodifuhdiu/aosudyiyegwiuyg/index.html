      <h2><span class="eyesorelogo">EyeSore</span> Lore</h2>
      <p>Mr. Christopher Spendlebrok was an ordinary person. Or so it seems. You see, Christopher was a wizard
        with a mission. The gods above are cruelly ruling the universe through wires, connections between a
        cause of death and an action. When something dies on the cause of death, the action that is connected to
        the cause of death through a wire is triggered.</p>
      <p>One day, the monocle falls from the sky. This is what the gods used to see and
        create the wires that control the universe. This is where the starting cutscene
        takes place, in the field outside Christopher's house, which, legend has it is
        inside of a farming simulator, although this hasn't been confirmed.
        Christopher exitedly picks up the
        monocle, as this could be the turning point, the thing that lets him destroy the
        gods. He puts it over his eye, and, for only a second, sees the wires. Unfortunately
        the gods know of his sins, and summon his eyeball to pop out and run underground,
        under which is a large cave system.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Christopher enchants a humble ice
        cream seller, who barges through the ground into the tunnels and starts chasing the eyeball.
        Unfortunately, in a cruel twist, because Christopher encarnated Ice Cream Kid as a
        last desperate messure, he is crushed by a cave-in triggered by the Ice Cream Kid's entrance to the caves. In
        the eyes of the gods, Christopher had commited many a terrible sin, and that was punishment built into the
        universe that the current gods' infinitely more powerful fathers had created.</p>
      <p>Beyond the site of one of the areas affected by the cave-in, using the double jump glitch, you can get to a
        memorial to Christopher, featuring an unused dark tileset and Christopher's other eye.
        There is some text which reads:</p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Nixie One', cursive; padding: 25px; width: 80%; margin: auto;">"In memory of
        Christopher Spendlebrok, who died fighting the gods. May this be a warning to all who seek to destroy
        powers they cannot understand. This is a warning that you have already heeded, eyeball. You have been
        forever trapped underground, along with
        the monocle. You must never defy the power of the gods."</p>
      <p class="twentyfour">
        In a way, Christopher's mission has been achieved. The gods are unable to continue ruling the universe, with no
        way to create and edit wires. However, there are many wires still in place, even if they are out of the gods' reach
        which still keep mortals from reaching any sort of power.
        Christopher's eyeball (who is not controlled by the gods anymore and now knows its mistakes)
        and the Ice Cream Kid both feel a need to avenge
        the death of Christopher, and so we might make a sequel to EyeSore, either in our free time or for <a
          href="https://ogpc.info" target="_blank">OGPC</a> (if the theme allows for it).
      </p>
      <p>
          Anyways, as the credits say, thank you so much for playing EyeSore if
          you did. This was a real challenge for all of our team and we are very
          proud of what we have accomplished. If you loved EyeSore and want to thank
          us, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EpimetheusGamesOGPC" target="_blank">
